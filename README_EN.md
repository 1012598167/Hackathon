# Hack for Wuhan
As volunteers and developers of Wuhan2020 community, we would like to invite you to our Hackathon: Hack for Wuhan, on 27th and 28th February, 2020. Let us hack together against the global crisis.

**We believe hackathon can not only inspire the next billion dollar unicorns, but also help unite mission-driven developers and innovators to combat an international outbreak crisis.**

We are looking forward to the novel designs, prototypes, business or social impact models. We believe that all efforts will make a profound impact.

We will provide professional technical supports to your inspiration, and you will have the opportunity to work with mentors from Stanford, MIT, Harvard, Andreessen Horowitz, GSR Venture, Google, Facebook, ByteDance and startups in Silicon Valley, China, and India.

Your every single effort for this fight against COVID-19 wherein all of us could keep the humanitarian spirits and open source values, can compose stories worth telling and precious memories to remember.
